# Drum Machine

This project is a Drum Machine created for the **Frontend Library Certificate** on [FreeCodeCamp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/). This takes the fundamental principles of react of handling event listeners to play Audio files based on the User's inputs. If the users press on the `drum-pad` element either through clicking or a keypress an audio sound will play. When a `drum-pad` is active the audio name will be displayed to the user.
